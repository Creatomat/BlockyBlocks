## Welcome to Blocky Blocks Resourcepack

This resource pack attempts to recreate the atmosphere of the Minecraft trailers while still offering a unique yet vanilla-esque style of textures. It is inspired by other packs like Barebones and OCD and still maintains true to vanilla texturing.

### Key Features

* Color schemes are consistent with the original Minecraft, with almost no new colors added.
* Adheres to the OCD style, emphasizing clean lines and consistent textures.
